              One of the early mining settlements in the territory of Donetsk
              was Aleksandrovka. The existence of
              <strong>Aleksandrovskaya Cossack Sloboda</strong> in its place is
              attested by 1779., with the Aleksandrovsky coal mine eventually
              being opened there. The city of Donetsk was founded in 1869 by
              Welsh businessman <strong>John Hughes</strong>. The worker's
              settlement at the plant merged with Aleksandrovka and the place
              was named <strong>Yuzovo</strong>, later <strong>Yuzovka</strong>,
              after Hughes.In its early period, it received immigrants from
              Wales, especially from the town of Merthyr Tydfil.By the beginning
              of the 20th century, Yuzovka had approximately 50,000
              inhabitants,and attained the status of a city in 1917.The main
              district of Yuzovka is named English Colony, and the British
              origin of the city is reflected in its layout and architecture.

              Under the Soviet Union, Yuzivka was renamed Stalino and, in 1961,
              Donetsk. Heavy destruction in World War II led to postwar
              modernization and an increase in industry, which resulted in
              substantial and sustained economic growth.
